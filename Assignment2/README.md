# Work for Assignment No.2

This report presents our solutions to Computer Exercise 2 of the course 02427 Advanced Time Series Analysis. 

Throughout the exercise, we study how model parameters can be estimated using the Prediction Error Method (Conditional Least Squares), and how the shape of the loss function reflects the accuracy and stability of these estimates. We also explore the formulation and simulation of doubly stochastic systems in state-space form, and apply the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to perform parameter estimation and analyze its convergence under different assumptions about noise and initialization.

The exercise provides practical insight into the behavior of estimation methods in both static and dynamic settings, bridging theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation.

Further details are provided in the report.
